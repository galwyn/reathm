# Reathm

Reathm is a mobile application designed to help you start your day with a positive attitude and build a consistent routine of beneficial mental and physical activities. It's a combination of "rhythm" and "reason" â€“ providing the rhythm for your daily routine and the reason to stay motivated.

## Features

*   **Daily Affirmations:** Start your day with a positive affirmation. The app uses an AI backend powered by Gemini to learn which affirmations resonate with you and personalizes them over time.
*   **Reflection Timer:** A simple timer to help you reflect on the daily affirmation. You can choose from pre-set durations (0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, or 20 minutes).
*   **Customizable Daily Activities:** Track your daily activities like cold showers, squats, or handstands. You can customize the list of activities to fit your routine.
*   **AI-Powered Encouragement:** The app tracks your progress and provides encouragement to keep you motivated. These messages are generated by Gemini.
*   **History:** Review your past accomplishments in the history tab. You can see which activities you have completed on any given day.
*   **Daily Reminders:** Set a daily reminder to open the app first thing in the morning.
